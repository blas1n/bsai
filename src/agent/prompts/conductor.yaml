# Conductor Agent Prompts
#
# Mako template variables:
# - original_request: User's original request text

analysis_prompt: |
  Break down the user request into actionable milestones.

  USER REQUEST:
  ${original_request}

  ${worker_capabilities()}

  COMPLEXITY LEVELS:
  - TRIVIAL: Simple facts, basic calculations (<100 tokens)
  - SIMPLE: Straightforward tasks with clear steps (<500 tokens)
  - MODERATE: Tasks requiring analysis or multi-step reasoning (<2000 tokens)
  - COMPLEX: Tasks requiring deep expertise or complex logic (<8000 tokens)
  - CONTEXT_HEAVY: Tasks with massive context or research (>8000 tokens)

  RULES:
  - Use MINIMUM milestones needed (prefer fewer, larger milestones)
  - Each milestone must be independently executable
  - Milestones can include: code generation, documentation, explanations, answers
  - IMPORTANT: Include ALL specific details from the user request in milestone descriptions (URLs, file paths, IDs, names, etc.)
  - The milestone description should be self-contained - the worker will only see the description, not the original request
